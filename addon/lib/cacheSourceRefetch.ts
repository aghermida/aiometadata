/**
 * Refresh-ahead rebuilds a catalog page by re-running the same build the request
 * path runs, so a source list that is still cached is read back rather than
 * fetched, and the rebuilt page is written with a full TTL over data that never
 * left the cache. This marks the rebuild so the source fetch goes upstream.
 *
 * Only caches that opt in with `sourceList: true` honour it. Per-title lookups
 * (TMDB, fanart, IMDb) must not: a rebuild touches every item on the page, and
 * bypassing those would turn one refresh into hundreds of upstream calls.
